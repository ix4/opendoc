# Getting Started 

[Github](https://github.com) is an online service that helps people collaborate on large projects remotely. OpenDoc makes use Github's platform to manage the documents and provide a simple user interface from which you can make changes to your documents. 

Before you proceed with the rest of this tutorial, we recommend that you take some time to complete the following online courses. Each course will take around half an hour to complete, and it will walk you through the user interface of Github, as well as some of the process flows that we'll be using for OpenDoc.

> **Introduction to Github** (Strongly recommend)

> [https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)

> **Communicating using Markdown** (Strongly recommend)

> [https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown)

> **Reviewing pull requests** (Optional)

> [https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/reviewing-pull-requests](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/reviewing-pull-requests)

More on this feature can be found [here](https://pages.github.com/).

## Creating an OpenDoc (IT administrators)

**Step 1:**

> If you __do not__ have a Github account, follow the steps [here](https://github.com/) to get one created.

> If you __already have an__ account on Github account, create a new repository and name it in the following convention: 

```opendoc-<name_of_document> e.g. opendoc-example-doc```

**Step 2:**

> Navigate into the working directory and clone the template repo onto your local machine.

```
cd <directory_path>
git clone git@github.com:opendocsg/opendoc-template.git
```

**Step 3:**

> Rename the folder to match the name of the repository that was created, and update the remote address for the repo on your local machine. This allows you to make changes to the online repository that was created.

```
mv opendoc-template opendoc-<name_of_document>
cd opendoc-<name_of_document>
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:opendocsg/opendoc-<name_of_document>.git
```

**Step 4:**

> Update the following configuration fields in the _config.yml file:

```
- title                           <------- Update
- repository 	                  <------- Update
- styling_options
	- primary_brand_color     <------- Update
	- logo_path               <------- Update
```

> Definitions:

> - title: Name of document
> - repository -> opendocsg/opendoc-<name_of_document>
> - primary_brand_colour: Primary brand color of Ministry/Agency publishing the document
> - logo_path: Path to logo file in this directory


**Step 5:**

> Copy the markdown documents into the root directory of the repo. The documents have to be in the markdown (.md) format, and you can find out more about getting the documents converted in the following section.

**Step 6:**

> Commit your changes, and update the online repository with the new version.

```
git add .
git commit -m <"commit_message">
git push origin master
```
